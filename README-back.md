## Using the Python Device SDK
IoT Hub also supports MQTT and AMQP protocols. These are generally more efficient and scale better than using the HTTP REST API. In order to use MQTT or AMQP with Python, you will need to download and compile the Python Device SDK on your Raspian operating system.

The full instructions are [here] (https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/doc/python-devbox-setup.md) with some Python SDK examples [here] (https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/master/device/samples).

In summary:
- ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git```
- ```cd azure-iot-sdk-python/build_all/linux```
- ```sudo ./setup.sh```
- ```sudo ./build.sh```

After a successful build, the ```iothub_client.so``` Python extension module is copied to the device/samples and service/samples folders. The iothub_client.so must be in the same folder as your IoT Hub client python script or in the common shared libraries folder such as ```/usr/local/lib``` or ```/usr/lib```.
