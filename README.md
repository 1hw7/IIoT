# IoT Hub Pi Hackathon Content

## Overview
This hackathon demonstrates connecting a Raspberry Pi running Raspian to [Azure IoT Hub] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/). The Raspberry Pi will be sending telemetry to Azure IoT Hub from either:
- a physical [Sense Hat] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/) connected to the Raspberry Pi; or
- a Sense Hat simulator installed on the Raspberry Pi.

### Why Sense Hat?
We didn't want to mess around with breadboards, jumper cables, resistors etc. This just wastes time and adds nothing to the goal of connecting a sensor to Azure IoT Hub. 

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 3 (Model 2+ will probably work as well) with latest version of Raspian installed on the micro SD card, 
- Sense Hat Simulator (which comes with the Raspian O/S)
- Sense Hat (optional - for those that want to play with real hardware)
- Laptop (running whatever operating system you desire) but ideally running Windows so you can install/run Device Explorer. 
- An Azure account (either a trial account, or a development subscription from your company). 

## Advanced Setup (Required prior to attending hackathon)
Please perform the following steps in advance of the hackathon otherwise you will waste the entire hackathon performing these steps.
- TBD

##//TODO
- Find out how to offer temp Azure subscriptions. I know there is a way...just need to find this.
- Order a real Sense Hat and test code sample.
